# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game project! This mini game is built using basic JavaScript and the DOM API, providing a fun and interactive experience directly in your web browser.

## Project Overview

This project features a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where users can play against the computer. The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, and the user interface is managed using the DOM. The game includes basic interaction where players choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The game then determines the winner and displays the result.
Files Included

    index.html: The HTML file that provides the structure of the game interface.
    styles.css: The CSS file used to style the game interface and layout.
    script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and interacts with the DOM.
